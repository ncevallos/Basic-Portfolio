    <p>
	I was originally born in Orlando, FL, but moved to Naples, FL while I was in grade school and graduated from there. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Finance with a minor in Computer Science, which I graduated with in December 2016. Currently I am enrolled in UCF Coding Bootcamp, in hopes of being able to secure a job in the future as a web developer.</p>
